# IT Expenditure Analysis – Power BI

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing IT expenditure data across regions, business units, and cost categories using Power BI. The objective is to provide clear visibility into Actual vs Forecast vs Planned IT spending, identify variance drivers, and support data-driven budgeting and cost optimization decisions.

The interactive dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor spending performance, detect overspending or underutilization, and drill down into cost details by IT area, department, and geography.

🎯 Business Problem

Organizations often struggle to:

Track IT budgets across multiple regions and departments

Compare actual, forecasted, and planned spending accurately

Identify key cost drivers such as labor, shared services, and infrastructure

This project addresses these challenges by delivering a centralized and interactive Power BI reporting solution.
